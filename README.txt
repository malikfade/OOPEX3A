This is the fourth project we do this Semester .. and it is about Developing a Data Structure of Directed Weighted Graphs , creating edges between nodes , and adding iron man and thanos and aliens to the graph , there are two types of enemies aliens and thanos each one has its own value , iron man kills as many villians as possible in the time that has been given to them . 
In this project we are able to make a Gui window and use it to draw the graph, iron man , aliens and thanos that we implemented.  

the Project allows you to choose between 24 different graph options , each graph has different number of iron man duplicates and villians , You can choose to play in two different modes:  
1)Manual- you initiate iron man on the specific node you want and then you start to click on the nodes that you want your iron man to get to.

2)automatic- by choosing the auto mode which locates the iron man duplicates on random nodes and move them automatically in the graph to kill as much villians as they can to get the highest score.


Created as an Object Oriented Programming Project during the second year at Ariel University in the Department of Computer Science.
